# âš¡Powerr
Powerr is a minimal typing test in early development with a smooth design, built with React and Tailwind. It is a "remake" of an older typing test I made a while ago called Quoteleaf, but with a more stable and responsive design. This project is heavily inspired by Monkeytype and is being developed as a way for me to improve my skills with React.


## Features
Minimalistic design,
Responsive and stable layout,
Ability to customize test parameters (e.g. number of words, time limit),
Track and display typing speed and accuracy,
